# MusicPlaya
A player that plays audio (eventually) and DOES NOTHING ELSE

The goal of this project is to create a very simple music player that suites my needs. Also I wanted to learn C# and Visual Studio. 

current beautiful and modern GUI:

See Images directory for older screenshots.

Currently only runs within Visual Studio (2015).

Uses ![Taglib](http://download.banshee.fm/taglib-sharp/) and ![NAudio](http://naudio.codeplex.com/)
